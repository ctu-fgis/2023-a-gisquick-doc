======================
Setting up the project
======================

This part of the documentation describes the process of setting up a project in the Gisquick web interface.
The procedure consists of a total of seven following steps/sections, :ref:`General <general>`, :ref:`Files <files>`,
:ref:`Map <map>`, :ref:`Layers <layers>`, :ref:`Topics <topics>`, :ref:`Permissions <permissions>` and
:ref:`Update <update>`. Appropriate project settings greatly affect the appearance and functionality of the resulting web map.

Before the actual setup, it is necessary to have the QGIS project uploaded to the Gisquick server,
for more information check :ref:`Before publishing <before-publishing>` and :ref:`Publishing <publishing>`.

How to access project settings check :ref:`Profile page <profile-page>`.

**Extent** can be defined in three ways:

*   by entering values of x-min, y-min, x-max and y-max
*   by moving extent boundary while holding **Shift** key (accessed by |extent-mod|)
*   by taking over from defined layer (accessed by |extent-lay|)
